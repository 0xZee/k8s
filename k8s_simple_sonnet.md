Certainly, I'll provide a comprehensive guide for building a Kubernetes cluster across two locations with the specified components. I'll structure this in Markdown format for clarity and educational purposes.

# Building a Kubernetes Cluster Across Two Locations

## 1. Dockerfile Example and Application Workflow

Let's start with a Dockerfile example for a Streamlit application, which will be one of the components in our Kubernetes cluster.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the Streamlit app code into the container
COPY app.py .

# Expose the port that Streamlit will run on
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
```

### Explanation of the Application Workflow in Kubernetes Architecture:

1. **Ingress**: External traffic enters the cluster through an Ingress controller (NGINX).
2. **Services**: Traffic is routed to appropriate services based on paths or hostnames.
3. **Deployments**: Services direct traffic to pods managed by deployments.
4. **Pods**: 
   - Streamlit app pods serve the user interface.
   - MongoDB pods store and retrieve data.
   - Grafana pods provide monitoring and visualization.
5. **ConfigMaps/Secrets**: Store configuration data and sensitive information.
6. **Persistent Volumes**: Provide durable storage for MongoDB and Grafana.

The application components are distributed across two locations (location_1 and location_2) for high availability and disaster recovery.

## 2. Kubernetes Configuration Explanation

### Namespace Configuration

We'll create separate namespaces for each component of our application:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: streamlit
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: mongodb
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: nginx
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: grafana
```

### Deployment Configuration

Example of a Streamlit deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: streamlit-app
  namespace: streamlit
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: streamlit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: streamlit
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: streamlit
        image: your-streamlit-image:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8501
```

### Service Configuration

Example of a Streamlit service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: streamlit-service
  namespace: streamlit
spec:
  selector:
    app: streamlit
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8501
  type: ClusterIP
```

### Ingress Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: main-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: streamlit-service
            port: 
              number: 80
```

## 3. Python Code for Kubernetes Monitoring

Here's a Python script with functions to gather stats and monitor Kubernetes resources:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load Kubernetes configuration
config.load_kube_config()

# Create API clients
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()

def get_namespace_resources(namespace):
    print(f"Resources in namespace {namespace}:")
    
    # Get pods
    pods = v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace)
    print("Pods:")
    for pod in pods.items:
        print(f"  - {pod.metadata.name}")
    
    # Get services
    services = v1.list_namespaced_service(namespace)
    print("Services:")
    for service in services.items:
        print(f"  - {service.metadata.name}")
    
    # Get deployments
    deployments = apps_v1.list_namespaced_deployment(namespace)
    print("Deployments:")
    for deployment in deployments.items:
        print(f"  - {deployment.metadata.name}")

def list_services_and_namespaces():
    print("Services across all namespaces:")
    services = v1.list_service_for_all_namespaces()
    for service in services.items:
        print(f"  - {service.metadata.name} (Namespace: {service.metadata.namespace})")
    
    print("\nNamespaces:")
    namespaces = v1.list_namespace()
    for ns in namespaces.items:
        print(f"  - {ns.metadata.name}")

def k8s_cheatsheet():
    print("Kubernetes Monitoring Cheatsheet:")
    print("1. Get all pods: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces")
    print("2. Get all services: kubectl get services --all-namespaces")
    print("3. Get all deployments: kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces")
    print("4. Describe a pod: kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>")
    print("5. Get pod logs: kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>")
    print("6. Get cluster events: kubectl get events --all-namespaces")
    print("7. Get node status: kubectl get nodes")
    print("8. Get resource usage: kubectl top nodes")
    print("9. Get pod resource usage: kubectl top pods --all-namespaces")

# Example usage
get_namespace_resources("streamlit")
list_services_and_namespaces()
k8s_cheatsheet()
```

This script provides functions to:
1. Get resources (pods, services, deployments) for a specific namespace
2. List all services and namespaces
3. Display a cheatsheet of useful kubectl commands for monitoring

To use this script, you'll need to install the `kubernetes` Python package:

```
pip install kubernetes
```

Make sure you have the proper Kubernetes configuration file (`~/.kube/config`) set up with the correct cluster credentials.

This comprehensive guide should help you set up and monitor a Kubernetes cluster across two locations with the specified components. Remember to adjust the configurations and code as needed for your specific use case.
